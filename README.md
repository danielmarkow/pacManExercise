# pacManExercise
## Introduction
This is another task of the MIT xPro full stack developer course. The goal is to make pacman move and bounce of the screen edges. Pacman moves by triggering the Run function every 20 seconds which adjusts the position. The checkPageBounds function is used to check if the position pacman is in has exceeded page bounds.
## Usage
Open solution.html and click on pacman.
